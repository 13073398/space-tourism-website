# 🌍 Dynamic Destination Page — Space Tourism Website

This section of the Space Tourism Website dynamically loads planetary data (e.g., Moon, Mars, Europa, Titan) using a local JSON file. It’s designed to be scalable and API-ready for future enhancements.

## 📦 Data Source

The planetary data is stored in a structured JSON file:

```json
{
  "destinations": [
    {
      "name": "Mars",
      "description": "Don’t forget to pack your hiking boots...",
      "distance": "225 mil. km",
      "travel": "9 months",
      "images": {
        "png": "./assets/destination/image-mars.png",
        "webp": "./assets/destination/image-mars.webp"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}

🔄 How It Works
The page uses JavaScript to fetch and parse the JSON file.

When a user clicks a destination tab (e.g., "Mars"), the script updates:

Planet name

Description

Distance and travel time

Image source


🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
JSON structure and parsing

DOM manipulation with JavaScript

Modular data-driven UI

API-ready architecture
